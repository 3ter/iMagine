You wake up to the soothing sound of waves.

You find yourself on a beach. You can feel the sun's warm light on your face.

A quick short flash of light catches your eye. It's a compass.

There is a formation of rocks to your left.

#look take compass

You now have a compass

#look at rocks

There is a small dent in the middle of the rocks. It looks like something belongs in here.

#Put compass on rocks

The rocks accept your gift. You see white light everywhere.

It's time to wake up!
