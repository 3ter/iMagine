You hear the sound of the waves.

You slowly open your eyes to find yourself at a beach. You cannot find another person around. It’s a stoney beach, with no visible sand. Clouds are darkening the sunlight on this day. You have no idea what time of the day it is and you don’t know for how long you have been here.

A sunbeam shines through the clouds, causing your eye to catch a reflection in the stones.

#go north/south/east/west 

You don’t know where either direction is. You didn’t see the sun set yet nor are there any stars visible.

#(inspect/look at/examine…) reflection

As you take a closer look at the reflection, you see that it is in fact a compass. 

#Take compass

You took the compass and it is now part of your inventory. Now you know which way the cardinal points are.

(upon coming back)
You are back on the stoney beach. You can still hear the waves. You remember waking up here and still don’t know how you got here. It already feels like it has been a long time.
