# beginning
`[Audio: Wave.ogg]`

You <span style="text-speed:500">open</span> your <span style="color:Red; font-size:16px;">eyes</span>.

You find yourself at a beach. <span style="text-speed:2000">You hear the waves come and go</span>, the <span style="color:red">red</span> sunset reflects on the <span style="color:blue">water’s</span> surface.

As the sunlight falls, a shiny <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold; font-size:25px">reflection</span> catches your eye.

`(Inspect reflection) > get_compass`

# get_compass
You walk closer to whatever it is that caught your eye.

It was glass that reflected sunlight into your eyes. Glass that belonged to a little device.<span style="text-speed:60"> </span>A compass.

`(Pick up compass) > got_compass`

# got_compass
`[Audio: Harp.ogg]`

You pick up the compass. Now you know which directions are north, east, south and west.

`(Go south)`

`[Audio: Wave.ogg]`

South is nothing but the sea. You do not have a boat with you to sail away - although you really would love to….

`(Go north)`

You see a forest but you can’t go there yet.

`(Go east)`

You see a rocky mountain but you can’t go there yet.

`(Go west) > gone_west`

# gone_west
You leave the sand on the ground and reach grass. A lighthouse is built here. You can see light on top. It’s not very bright. You wonder if someone lives here.

`(enter lighthouse) > lighthouse_enter`

# lighthouse_enter
You enter the lighthouse. The door was not locked. The inside looks abandoned, as if the last time a human inhabited this room was over a decade ago.
